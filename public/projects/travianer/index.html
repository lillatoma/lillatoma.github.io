<p>This is a <strong>Unity game project</strong> made with Unity 2022.3.13f1. This project was done with the collaboration of Viktória Horváth, who helped in many graphical, and coding assets of the project.
The project is based on the web browser, war strategy game, Travian by Travian Games GmbH. Assets are reused from the original Travian project, and we do not own any of them. They are the intellectual property of Travian Games GmbH.
The game was originally made for PC, and this WebGL version below is not optimized, and some assets might have different scaling because of it. I recommend playing it in 1920x1080 fullscreen.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: all other players in the game are controlled by bots.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose full screen, you might have to click again in the game screen for it to take effect.</p>

  <h1 id="whats-in-the-game">What&rsquo;s in the game?</h1> 

<p>Currently, the goal of the game is just build, and fight. There is no further goal, you can set whatever you want. To be the biggest player in the gameworld (that has bots), get medals, have the biggest army, destroy other bots, etc. You name it.</p>









  <h2 id="buildings"><a class="anchor" href="#buildings" title='Anchor for: Buildings.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Buildings</h2> 

<p>Most buildings from the original game exist and are functional, except Wonder of the World and Treasury. Buildings can be built if there is enough resource, which are produced by the resource fields in the outer village, the resource production bonus buildings in the inner village, the captured oases, and the hero. There is also a premium option which the player can activate to have bigger production. (It costs in game gold, which is free, don&rsquo;t worry.) It is advised to build resource production to as high as possible. Every building has a different purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Woodcutter</strong>: increases lumber production</li>
<li><strong>Clay Pit</strong>: increases clay production</li>
<li><strong>Iron Mine</strong>: increases iron production</li>
<li><strong>Cropland</strong>: increases crop production</li>
<li><strong>Main Building</strong>: reduces building time</li>
<li><strong>(Great) Warehouse</strong>: increases storage of lumber, clay, and iron.</li>
<li><strong>(Great) Granary</strong>: increases storage of crop</li>
<li><strong>Sawmill</strong>: increases lumber production (5% per level)</li>
<li><strong>Brickyard</strong>: increases clay production (5% per level)</li>
<li><strong>Iron Foundry</strong>: increases iron production (5% per level)</li>
<li><strong>Grainmill</strong>: increases crop production (5% per level)</li>
<li><strong>Bakery</strong>: increases crop production (5% per level)</li>
<li><strong>Embassy</strong>: increases alliance player limit by 3 per level</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace</strong>: increases the number of merchants that can carry resources to other villages</li>
<li><strong>City Wall, Palisade, Earth Wall, Stone Wall, Makeshift Wall, Defensive Wall</strong>: increases the static defense of the town, and also increases the power of the defensive force inside</li>
<li><strong>Cranny</strong>: hides an amount of resources from raiders</li>
<li><strong>Palace</strong>: opens an expansion slot at 10, 15, 20, can train settlers &amp; commanders, adds the possibility to change capital</li>
<li><strong>Residence</strong>: opens an expansion slot at 10, 20, can train settlers &amp; commanders</li>
<li><strong>Command Center</strong>: opens an expansion slot at 10, 15, 20, can train settlers &amp; commanders (can only be built by Huns)</li>
<li><strong>Rally Point</strong>: opens target options for catapults, shows the number of attackers if they are numbered below the level of the rally point</li>
<li><strong>Barracks</strong>: can train infantry soldiers and infantry spies, the higher the level, the faster the training of troops</li>
<li><strong>Academy</strong>: can research infantry and cavalry that are not yet researched</li>
<li><strong>Tournament Square</strong>: increases movement speed of troops by 20% per level if the distance is over 20.</li>
<li><strong>Smithy</strong>: can increase the power of researched troopers, the higher the smithy, the faster the upgrades are. Upgrades have levels, and smithy can only upgrade as high as its level.</li>
<li><strong>Hero&rsquo;s Mansion</strong>: unlocks an oasis slot at 10, 15 and 20. Oases can be captured to increase production. Adventures spawn near villages that have hero&rsquo;s mansion (and the capital).</li>
<li><strong>Town Hall</strong>: can run celebrations (small from level 1, large from level 10). The higher its level, the faster the celebrations are.</li>
<li><strong>Stable</strong>: can train cavalry soldiers and cavalry spies, the higher the level, the faster the training of troops</li>
<li><strong>Great Barracks and Great Stable</strong>: works the same as their &ldquo;non-great&rdquo; equivalents, but troops cost 3x as much</li>
<li><strong>Workshop</strong>: can produce rams and catapults, the higher the level, the faster the training of troops</li>
<li><strong>Trade Office</strong>: increases the capacity of merchants by 20% per level. (40% for Romans).</li>
<li><strong>Horse Drinking Trough</strong>: Roman only building, increases training speed of cavalries, while decreasing their crop consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Waterworks</strong>: Egyptian only building, increases production bonus of oases.</li>
<li><strong>Trapper</strong>: Gauls only building, can produce traps that can capture attackers on the village.</li>
<li><strong>Stonemason</strong>: Capital only building, increases building stability</li>
<li><strong>Hospital</strong>: If the village has hospital, 40% of lost troops in battles become injured, and they can be healed in the hospital. (Healing costs the same as producing troops, but takes half as much time.)</li>
<li><strong>Asclepeion</strong>: Hospital that can be built by Spartans only. The 40% injured ratio becomes 60%.</li>
<li><strong>Brewery</strong>: Teuton and capital only building. Can run celebrations that increase the attack power of all troops.</li>
</ul>









  <h2 id="attacking-oases"><a class="anchor" href="#attacking-oases" title='Anchor for: Attacking oases:.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Attacking oases:</h2> 

<p>The player can attack oases at any given time. Oases have a set of animals they spawn with, and they spawn a larger amount when the initial beginner&rsquo;s protection of the world ends. If they have been cleaned once, they will produce animals regularly. Killing animals gives resources to the hero&rsquo;s inventory, so it is a viable tactic to attack them, if you would gain more resources than what you used to train the lost troops. Oases also produce resources and have a capacity how much they can store, however they only start producing once they have been cleaned.
Oases can be captured if the hero&rsquo;s mansion is big enough, and the oases have been cleaned from animals. For this to happen, the player has to attack it with hero.
If the oasis attacked has been captured by a previous player, animals will not spawn there anymore, and the attacker will fight the village that the oasis belongs to (or rather the troops sent to the oasis.), and if the attacker robs resources, they are from that village. (Resources in the oasis are 10% of what the village has, and robbing the oasis robs directly from the village.)</p>









  <h2 id="attacking-other-villages"><a class="anchor" href="#attacking-other-villages" title='Anchor for: Attacking other villages:.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Attacking other villages:</h2> 

<p>When the beginner&rsquo;s protection of both players are over, they can attack each other. When an attack happens, the troops that have been sent by the attacker will fight with all troops that are in the defender&rsquo;s village. Raid attack means that if the attacker loses <code>n%</code> and the defender loses <code>m%</code>, then <code>n + m</code> will be <code>100%</code>. Normal attack or attack means that the fight goes on until either the attacker or the defender loses all their troops. These fights happen immediately. If the attacker has surviving troops, they can steal resources from the village, so it is a viable tactic to rob resources from players who don&rsquo;t defend them.
In order to destroy wall and buildings in the village, or conquer them, the attack has to be normal (not raid).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t develop an ingame battle simulator yet. In order to simulate a battle, please use this site:

  <h2 id="time-management-in-the-game"><a class="anchor" href="#time-management-in-the-game" title='Anchor for: Time management in the game:.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Time management in the game:</h2> 

<p>In the game, time is static and is not going with real time. The player can manage their time and when they want to jump into the future (until a building built, training done, troop movement done, etc, or freely in the Events menu.) This is a unique mechanic that is not present in the original Travian game, and is done so the player can maximize their potential (by being second perfect at it).
The events (building built, attacks, etc) that are scheduled to happen at a given time would fire if the given time is before the time jump ends. (So let&rsquo;s say, cropland builds at 02:00, but you jump until 05:00 where an attack happens, both events will be fired.)</p>









  <h2 id="hero"><a class="anchor" href="#hero" title='Anchor for: Hero.'><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#hashtag"/></svg></a> Hero</h2> 

<p>The hero is a unique troop of every player, that can level up, and has points that can go on power, attack bonus, defense bonus and production. The hero starts with a set of 3 adventures, and will get more adventures overtime. The first 10 adventures have a fixed set of rewards, and adventures later will get rewards randomly. These rewards can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>resources (most common)</li>
<li>silver (can be used in auctions)</li>
<li>troops</li>
<li>consumable items (ointments, cages, small bandages, bandages, tablets of law, books of wisdom, artwork and bucket)</li>
<li>other items (helmets, armors, boots, weapons, utilities, and horses)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to bid on auctions to get items from other players who are selling them. It is not possible to see the seller, however the highest bidder is always visible. Once the auction&rsquo;s timer go off, the highest bidder will receive the item, get their extra silver back, and the seller will get the final silver amount that was bid on the item.</p>

<li>conquer a village from another player. In order for it to happen, the player has to lower the loyalty of a non-capital village to 0, with normal attacking with commanders. Once the loyalty becomes 0, the new owner of the village will be the attacker.</li>
