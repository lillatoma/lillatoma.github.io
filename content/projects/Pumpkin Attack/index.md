This game was made as a challenge to myself. I wanted to see if I could create a game in a single day, more specifically in 8 hours.
Unfortunately I failed, because I still needed an extra 4-ish hours to finish this project.

The game is themed on Halloween day, where a kid is left out in a small suburban neighborhood, and he has to collect baskets of candies. However, he is attacked by zombies, witches and jumping pumpkins.
Once, he collects all the candies, he will be summoned by the Pumpkin King, and he has to defeat the Pumpkin King to restore peace into the neighborhood.

The GitHub repository of the game can be found here:
