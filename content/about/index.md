I am Lilla Toma, my first programming project was made in 2017, in the summer right before I went to university. This project was quite broad, and I think it was way above the level of an absolute beginner. During the project, I learned a lot about data types, pointers, how to make functions, how to fix bugs I made, and a little bit about how programs work, and reverse engineering. For the following 2 years (2017-2019), I was making projects that I felt I needed in my life, sometimes for university, or just for fun. In 2019, I started working with the SFML multimedia library, and it was a new challenge, and with it I started my game development journey. In 2021, I started learning Unity, and learned a lot about game engines, particularly Unity itself, and made several smaller projects on the way. At the end of 2022, I started learning Unreal Engine 5, and I have been alternating between the above-mentioned engines and technologies.

I believe I am: 
- hard-working
- willing to learn
- in love with challenges
- stubborn and I will sit over problems until they are done
- solution-oriented
- communicative.

And I want to share what I experience during my career, and want to be able to teach others what I learn(ed).

I am interested in technology, in video games, secrets about how they were made, and I also wonder about them a lot, I like going out, and I am a cat addict.
